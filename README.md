# Django Real Estates

#### Introduction
This repo contains my final project for the **Program Design Methods** class from my Computer Science major at Binus University. The project was a program written in Python since that was the programming language we learn during the first semester. I've chosen to do a Django project because I enjoy building web applications and because of my experience with Django.

#### About
**Django Real Estates** is the name of my project, because It's build with DJango and it advertises properties and I felt unispired to come up with a fancy name. The web application simply allows property agents to advertise their properties. After registering using an email address they can fill in the form to create their agency profile and after that start uploading their properties.
